  "excerpt": "Learn why the future belongs to AI generalists who can connect skills, solve problems, and collaborate with AI across disciplines.",
  "content": "<p>For years, we were told to specialize: pick a skill, master it, and stick to it. That advice made sense in the pre-AI world. But today, AI can perform specialized tasks — coding, writing, designing, and analyzing — faster than most humans. This is where being a generalist becomes a real advantage.</p><h2>1. Understand the Role of an AI Generalist</h2><p>An AI generalist is someone who knows enough across multiple domains — writing, coding, design, automation, business — to connect ideas and solve problems. They use AI as a partner, not a competitor, to amplify their abilities.</p><h2>2. Breadth Beats Depth Now</h2><p>Specialization used to be the gold standard. Now, AI provides access to deep expertise instantly. What’s rare is the ability to <strong>connect disciplines, spot patterns, and adapt quickly</strong>. Generalists can see solutions others miss.</p><h2>3. How to Think Like an AI Generalist</h2><ul><li><strong>Stay curious:</strong> Explore topics outside your comfort zone.</li><li><strong>Build small:</strong> Launch mini projects that combine tools and ideas.</li><li><strong>Focus on problems:</strong> Ask \"What am I trying to solve?\" before \"Which tool should I use?\"</li></ul><h2>4. Collaborate with AI</h2><p>AI excels at executing tasks and generating content. A generalist guides AI by providing context, making strategic decisions, and combining outputs creatively. The AI does the heavy lifting, while the human connects the dots.</p><p>In the AI era, adaptability, curiosity, and the ability to link ideas across domains matter more than narrow expertise. If you’ve ever felt like you don’t fit into one box, you’re already wired to thrive as a generalist. Embrace this mindset, experiment widely, and use AI as your partner to solve new challenges and create opportunities.</p>"
